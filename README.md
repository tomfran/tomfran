# Hi, I'm Francesco

### About me
I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Satispay. I have a Master's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Milan, during which I developed a keen interest in a range of topics, including distributed systems, compression techniques, and machine learning.

### Projects 
I am currently working on an [LSM Tree](https://github.com/tomfran/LSM-Tree) Java implementation, here are some on my completed projects:
- [Graph compression via ANS](https://github.com/tomfran/ANS-Graph-compression): Master's thesis work on graph compression via asymmetric numeral systems;
- [Last.fm users analysis](https://github.com/tomfran/lastfm-users-analysis): data collection from Last.fm api and analysis in GCP via Spark;
- [Caselaw temporal analysis](https://github.com/tomfran/caselaw-temporal-analysis): temporal analysis of legal texts via topic modelling and temporal word embeddings;
- [Drones distributed system](https://github.com/tomfran/dronazon): simulated drones system, main topics are election, concurrency, gRCP, pub/sub;
- [Urban sound classification](https://github.com/tomfran/urban-sound-classification): multi-class classification on UrbanSound8K dataset using neural networks.
